## **How to Contribute**

### 1. Fork the Repository
- Click on the ‚ÄúFork‚Äù button at the top right of this repository to create your copy of the project.

### 2. Clone Your Fork
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fsdmitclub-platform.git
  ```
- Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.

### 3. Configure Upstream
- Set up the original repository as `upstream` to keep your fork updated:
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/Fsdm-IT-AI-Club/fsdmitclub-platform.git
  ```

### 4. Create a Branch
- Work on your features or fixes in a separate branch. This helps keep your changes isolated from others:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```

### 5. Make Changes
- Make your changes locally. Ensure proper coding standards are followed:
    - Java: Follow industry Java conventions.
    - Thymeleaf templates: Create clean and readable frontend code.
    - Other standards for consistency.

### 6. Test Your Changes
- Run and test your changes thoroughly to ensure no breaking issues.
- Test unit and integration tests using Maven:
  ```bash
  mvn test
  ```

### 7. Commit Your Changes
- Use descriptive commit messages to explain what your changes do:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Brief description of the changes"
  ```

### 8. Push to Your Fork
- Push your branch to **your fork**:
  ```bash
  git push origin feature/your-feature-name
  ```

### 9. Create a Pull Request
- Open a pull request (PR) from your branch on your forked repository to `main` in the original repository.
- Fill out the PR description according to the provided template. Explain:
    - What the issue is (if applicable)
    - How you resolved it
    - Steps to verify your changes

## **Contribution Guidelines**

Please follow these guidelines to keep the project organized and maintain high-quality contributions:

### 1. Code Style
- Follow the standard Java conventions (e.g., proper indentations, meaningful variable/method names).
- Use comments where necessary to explain complex logic.

### 2. Documentation
- Update relevant documentation (e.g., README, code comments) for any new features or fixes.
- This helps others understand the purpose and function of your changes.

### 3. Testing
- Ensure all code changes are tested before submitting a PR.
- Contribute unit or integration tests for new features.

### 4. Respect Version Control
- Do not commit directly to the `main` branch.
- All commits should be associated with a specific issue and handled in branches similar to `feature/issue-number`.
